## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project started because of a need I personally have. I want to play golf in all 50 states and I want an easy way to document the rounds I have played and keep track of the ones I have marked off. The application will be a place where users can both mark off a state they have played in and also give them the ability to upload photos, scorecards, and other pieces of information pertaining to each round. 

There will be a home page that will either be a map with states crossed off or a list with completed states. The completed states will link to a page of info the user has submitted. Another possible part of the application will be the ability for users to add a wish list of courses as a list in each non-completed state.


### Features
Include Features here

Features include the following:
1: User login: Users can login and view states they have played/yet to play.
2: Add a state: Users can add a completed state.
3: Add info about completed state: Users will have the option to upload photos and scorecards in addition to basic info like date, price, who they played with, weather, etc.
4: Users can add a course to a non played state.

Additional features that may take longer to implement: Google maps integration, blog page where users can share their experiences/courses with others so users can view them to consider where they want to play in a state.
